Datasets
========
- Reference genome
	Analysis requires a number of reference datasets. A `ressource bundle
	<ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/>`_ 
	with all necessary files for the GATK workflow is provided by the Broad Institute.
	The link contains bundles for a number of different versions of the human reference genome; 
	in the NEXT bioinformatics network we use the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) version of the GRCh38 reference genome. 
	The reference genome and associated index files is available for download `here
	<https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/data-harmonization-and-generation/gdc-reference-files>`_
